Julia vs. Python
Both are open source
Python is OOP; Juliia has both object-oriented and functional programming
python is dynamically typed; Julia is also dynamically typed but you can specify types beforehand


Julia is compipled at JIT or at runtime using the LLVM framework. 
This is where Julia truly beats Python: speed.

Binary Search 
Binary search in Julia is much more faster
I did a benchmark on an array with a size of 500000 and 1000000 times calls for binary search.
Julia just use 0.062137 seconds (2 allocations: 3.815 MiB)
But, Python needs Time:  8.1868795s
