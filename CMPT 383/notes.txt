Type Classes (=>)

Eq  :  ==  /=
Ord :  Eq and < >= min
Num :  +  *  abs
Fractional : Num and / recip
Show : to string
Enum : has previous or next elements (succ)


Language Choice
	popularity
	tools : windows IDE
	libraries / toolkits
	syntax : ; or indenting
	implementation : how to write compilers


A compiler is a program that translateds a program from one representation to another. This is source code to machine code.
higher-level -> lower-level

Manchine code : instructions for the processor. The target could be something other than machine code

Assembly language : more human-readable but almost one-to-one with manchine code

Source-to-source translation (transpiling) : converting between higher-level representations

interpreter : a piece of software that takes a program in some language (!= machine code) and executes it

Just-in-time compilation

LLVM compiler

Duck Typing
Dynamic typing is slow but flexible

strongly typed
  C and Java

mutable/immutable data
mutable obj/value: can be modified after initialzing
  easy to work with
  collection
immutable
  e.g. Integer in Java, C#
  can be changed by assigning a brand new obj
  dictionary/map/hash table keys
  as an argument
  sharing between threads 
  tuple in python

ways to enforce mutability
  private
  const

Memory Management
  Static
    strings
  Stack
    function params and function-local variables
  Heap
    dynamically-allocated objs
    mallocc in c
    new in c++, java, c#
    all objs in python, ruby

memory leak

garbage collection
  reference counting: delete when decreasing to zero reference to the obj
  tracing: delete evreything is not reachable from references

C++ unique_ptr
  it will delete the obj it refers to automatically

First-Class Fucntions
  functions can be treated like value
  be pass as argument
  stored in a list
 
Closures
