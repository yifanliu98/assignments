<p>Types of Programming Languages</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Array Languages</dt>
	<dd>Array programming languages generalize operations on scalars to apply transparently to vectors, matrices, and higher-dimensional arrays.</dd>

	<dt>Assembly Languages</dt>
	<dd>Assembly languages directly correspond to a machine language, although there may not be a 1-1 mapping between an individual statement and an individual instruction, so machine code instructions appear in a form understandable by humans. Assembly languages let programmers use symbolic addresses, which the assembler converts to absolute or relocatable addresses. Most assemblers also support macros and symbolic constants.</dd>

	<dt>Authoring Languages</dt>
	<dd>An authoring language is a programming language used to create tutorials, websites, and other interactive computer programs.</dd>

	<dt>Constraint Programming Languages</dt>
	<dd>A constraint programming language is a declarative programming language where relationships between variables are expressed as constraints. Execution proceeds by attempting to find values for the variables which satisfy all declared constraints.</dd>
